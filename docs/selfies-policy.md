**Selfies Policy**

To ensure compliance with Discord's guidelines for non-18+ servers, and to promote body positivity and respect for all our our members, we have established the following guidelines regarding the #selfies channel and related content.

**No Shaming:** Respect people's bodies and identities. Don't make negative or derogatory comments or judgments about appearances or settings, or whether a person passes or not.

**No Suggestive Content:** We ask that you refrain from posting suggestive content, as it may encourage or facilitate dating, which is prohibited by #rules #6 and Discord ToS.

**Mod Guarantee**: Our moderation team will not implement any rules or judgments regarding body or dress that could lead to shaming. We will do our best to evaluate #selfies and related content with great sensitivity and consideration for the intent and context.

By implementing this policy, we aim to strike a balance that allows for personal expression while maintaining a safe and welcoming environment. We encourage you to engage with #selfies in a supportive manner, fostering a space where folx can freely express themselves without fear of judgment.
