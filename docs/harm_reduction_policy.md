**Harm Reduction Policy**

We aim to foster an environment that provides education, support, and resources for trans people without judgment. In doing so, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our server members by working to reduce harm.

**Non-Judgment:** Create an accepting space for discussing risk behaviors without stigma. Encourage understanding, empathy, and support.

**Education:** Share accurate information about the risks of substance use, unprotected sex and self-harm.

**Safer Substance Use:** Promote safer consumption, dosing guidelines, and awareness of interactions with HRT.

**Safer Sexual Practices:** Advocate for barrier methods, regular STI testing, and raise awareness about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for reducing STI risks.

**Self-Harm and Mental Health:** Offer resources for counseling, helplines, and crisis intervention. Encourage self-care and supportive discussions on coping strategies.

**Community Support:** Facilitate peer networks. Encourage seeking support from local transgender organizations and LGBTQ+ harm reduction resources.


Together, we can build a supportive community that respects unique experiences.
