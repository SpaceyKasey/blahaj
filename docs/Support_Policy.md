**Policy Name:** Mindful Sharing and Mutual Support in a Shared Space
Support Channel: Our ‘Support’ channel is specifically designated for members to share their experiences, thoughts, and emotions. We encourage all members to use this space for these discussions, helping to create a focused and supportive environment.

**Mindful Content Sharing:** Members should be aware that their words can have an impact on others. We ask that you be mindful of the content you share, particularly if it involves negative self-talk, personal distress, or potentially triggering experiences.

**Content Warnings and Tags:** To respect all members’ boundaries, please use appropriate content warnings and spoiler tags for sensitive or potentially triggering content. This allows others to make an informed choice about what they engage with.

**Respecting Individual Journeys:** We understand and respect that every person’s experience with gender identity is unique. Statements that could be seen as generalizing or negating individual experiences are not constructive and may inadvertently cause distress to others.

**Understanding Our Role:** While our ‘Support’ channel is a place for community, sharing, and mutual aid, it’s essential to remember that we’re not equipped to provide professional mental health services. Please consider seeking professional help when necessary.

**Moderation:** Our moderators are here to maintain a respectful and supportive environment. They will intervene when necessary and provide resources, but their role is not to provide therapy or professional support.
