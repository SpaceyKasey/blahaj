**Moderation Policy**

**Reporting violations**

If you encounter rule-breaking on our server, report it to our moderation team for arbitration. Due to safety concerns, do not attempt to intervene or take independent action.

To report a violation, you can either mention the @Mod Team role, or send a modmail by direct messaging @transprogrammer modmail#5421.

When reporting violations, please provide as much detail as possible, including usernames and a description of what happened.

Our moderation team will review all reports promptly and take appropriate action.

**Moderation Actions** 

Depending on the severity of a violation, our mod team may issue verbal warnings, timeouts, extended timeouts, temporary bans or permanent bans. If you have an issue with a particular judgement made by the mod team, send a modmail by direct messaging @transprogrammer modmail#5421 to appeal the action. Do not retaliate against mods or others for judgements made, as this may result in further action being taken.   

**Good Faith**

As mods we strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for all of our members, and we rely on your help and cooperation to maintain that standard. While enforcing the rules, we may require some patience and understanding, as we may need time to review reports and assess violations. Thank you for helping us keep our server friendly, safe and welcoming.
