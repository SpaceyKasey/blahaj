# Moderation Policy

## Reporting violations.

If you encounter rule violations on our server, report them to our moderation team for arbitration. Due to safety concerns, do not attempt to intervene or take independent action.

To report a violation, you can either mention the \@Mod Team role or send a modmail by direct messaging @transprogrammer modmail#5421.

When reporting a violation, please provide as much detail as possible, including the user's name and a brief description of what happened.

Our moderation team will review all reports promptly and take appropriate action.

## Moderation Actions 

Depending on severity, our mod team will excercise verbal warnings, timeouts, extended timeouts, temporary bans and permanent bans for rule violations. If you have an issue with a particular judgement made by the mod team, send a modmail by direct messaging @transprogrammer modmail#5421 to appeal. Do not retaliate against mods or others for judgements as this will result in further action being taken   

## Good-faith

As mods we strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for all our members, and we rely on your help and cooperation to maintain that standard. While enforcing the rules, we may require some patience and understanding, as we may need time to review reports and assess violations. Thank you for helping us keep our Discord server a friendly and welcoming community.
