**Selfies Policy**

To promote body positivity and respect, and to comply with Discord's guidelines for non-18+ servers, we have established the following guidelines regarding the #selfies channel and related content.

**No Body Shaming:** Respect people's bodies and identities. Don't make derogatory comments about a person's body, appearance or backdrop. Don't speculate as to whether a person passes or not. Don't make assumptions about weight, height, skin color, disability or hygiene.

**No Suggestive Content:** We ask that you refrain from posting suggestive content, as it may encourage or facilitate dating, which is prohibited by #rules #6 and the Discord Terms of Service.

**Our Guarantee**: We the moderation team will not issue any rules or judgments regarding people's body or dress as depicted in #selfies, as this would promote body shaming. We will do our best to evaluate #selfies and related content for non-18+ ToS compliance with sensitivity and consideration for content's intent and context.

By implementing this policy, we aim to strike a balance that allows for personal expression while maintaining a safe and welcoming environment at transprogrammer. We encourage you to engage with #selfies in a supportive manner, fostering a space where folx can freely express themselves without fear of judgment.
