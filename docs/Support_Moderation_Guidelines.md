**Encourage Appropriate Use of Support Channel:** Direct members to share experiences or concerns in the ‘Support’ channel. By focusing these discussions in one place, we can better monitor the conversation and ensure everyone’s wellbeing.

**Content Warnings and Tags:** Encourage members to use content warnings and spoiler tags for potentially triggering content. This allows others to make an informed decision about whether they’re comfortable engaging with the post.

**Respectful and Mindful Discussions:** Guide members to engage in discussions that are respectful and considerate. This includes being mindful of how certain statements, even when they’re about personal experiences, could impact others.

**Challenge Negative Assumptions:** If a member is expressing a negative belief that could be harmful to themselves or others, intervene with a supportive, validating response. Remind them that everyone’s experiences and journeys are different and valid in their own right.

**Reinforce Boundaries and Offer Resources:** If a member is dealing with significant distress, remind them about the purpose of the channel and the limitations of the support it can provide. Offer resources for professional help where necessary.

**Self-Care for Moderators:** Acknowledge that moderating such a channel can be taxing. Ensure there’s a supportive network within the moderation team and take turns in handling difficult or high-stress situations.

**Consistent Policy Enforcement:** Ensure that all rules and policies are consistently enforced across channels. Encourage members to actively use the ‘Support’ channel for their discussions and share the new guidelines with them.

**Create a Safe Space:** Strive to create an environment where members can speak their minds without judgement, while also considering the potential impact of their words on others. Moderators aren’t therapists, but they can help guide conversations towards healthier and more constructive dialogues.
