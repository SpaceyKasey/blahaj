**Content Policy**

Our community is committed to providing all members with a safe and welcoming space. As such, we have established this content policy to ensure that all content posted on our platform is respectful, appropriate, and aligned with our community rules.


**Prohibited Content**

The following types of content are prohibited on our platform:

**Hate Speech**: Any content that promotes or incites hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

**Harassment**: Any content intended to intimidate, bully, or harass an individual or group.

**Adult Content**: Any content that is sexually explicit, sexually charged, violent, or otherwise inappropriate for all ages.

**Misinformation**: Any content that is intentionally false or misleading, notably if it may cause harm to individuals or the community.

**Flashing and Fast-Moving Graphics**: To protect members who may be sensitive to flashing or fast-moving images, any content containing such graphics must be properly spoilered and include a content warning. This helps to prevent potential harm or discomfort for individuals with photosensitivity, epilepsy, or other related conditions.

**Sudden Loud Noises**: When sharing videos that contain sudden or excessively loud noises, please include a content warning and spoiler tag. This consideration helps to protect members who may be sensitive to such noises or have hearing-related conditions.

**Triggering Content**: Members must be mindful of sharing content that may be triggering for others. Any content that discusses or depicts potentially distressing topics (e.g., self-harm, abuse, eating disorders, or suicide) should be spoilered and accompanied by a content warning. This enables members who may be sensitive to these topics to avoid exposure to potentially harmful content.

**Illicit Content**: We expressly prohibit any content that violates Discord's Terms of Service Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, malicious software, pirated media, and exploitative or abusive imagery.

**Discrimination Policy**: We strictly prohibit discriminatory content based on gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, or any protected categories. This includes jokes or slurs, even if meant as "harmless" or "for fun."

**Exceptions**: Respectful, constructive discussions on these topics are allowed. Reclaimed slurs may be used in specific circumstances, such as self-identification. Enforcement and interpretation are at the discretion of moderators, who may take disciplinary action for misuse.


**Moderation**

Our moderators will review all content posted on our platform and have the authority to remove any content that violates this policy. Members who repeatedly violate this policy may face moderator actions, including timeouts, or a temporary or permanent ban.


**Appeals Process**

If a member believes that the moderators mistakenly removed their content or that they have been unfairly penalized, they can appeal the decision by contacting our moderation team. The team will review the appeal and make a final decision.
